# Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) - 3D Scene Reconstruction

This project implements a **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)** model to reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images using deep learning. The notebook demonstrates training, rendering, and visualization of novel views using a neural network-based volumetric rendering pipeline.
